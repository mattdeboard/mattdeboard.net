    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week or two ago I decided to stop using Tumblr and &amp;quot;roll my own&amp;quot; blog. Since I've been using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; to put &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mattdeboard.net/projects"&gt;some projects&lt;/a&gt; on the web, I decided to give &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog"&gt;rstblog&lt;/a&gt; a go. (Both written by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org"&gt;same guy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rstblog is very much a very &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; blog app, with only very minimal documentation. Thankfully &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sbhr.dk/2010/11/30/using_rstblog/"&gt;Morten Siebuhr&lt;/a&gt; put together a nice beginner's course on how to implement it. I referenced it heavily, though there were still some bumps on the road. Mostly, it took me awhile to realize you have to rm -r _build/ everytime you run-rstblog build. I was wondering why all of my links weren't updating; it was because when you do &amp;quot;run-rstblog build&amp;quot;, it only seems to create templates that already exist. I don't have a great explanation. But if you're looking for rstblog tips, here's mine: rm -r _build/ every time you run-rstblog build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also added a link to select projects in the header and generally cleaned and centralized everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting my blog in a somewhat finalized form also marks the end of the beginning of my movement toward setting up my own web server to function as a place to host my own projects, including the blog. I realize for most people who will read this running a webserver isn't that big a deal, and maybe even something you were doing in high school or before. But for me, this has been a new thing and a tremendous learning experience. Much thanks to Brett Hoerner for his &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bretthoerner.com/2008/10/9/configs-for-nginx-and-apache-mod-wsgi"&gt;post on configuring Apache2 and nginx&lt;/a&gt; for mod_wsgi. They've been a great reference source as I fumble with those two services.&lt;/p&gt;
