Projects
========

I am both a formal computer science student at `IUPUI <http://www.iupui.edu>`_ as well as an enthusiastic autodidact when it comes to programming and computer science. 

The projects I've completed so far have for the most part but mostly meaningless to the world at large. I have linked to them below. The link is either to their location where they are hosted here on my server or to the github repo if unhosted. 

They are listed in chronological order with the most recent projects first.

Links
-----

`Yuk`_: A pinboard clone I started explicitly to learn more about databases and get my feet wet with Django.

`flask_rage`_: A simple text overlay I wrote just as a joke for some friends. I recently refactored the project for use with flask. This project taught me quite a lot about apache and nginx configs.

`Change`_: A "make change out of this" project for my Computing I class. Obviously a canonical computer science project so I wanted to do something "cute" with it.

`trunkly-rss`_: I wrote about this project `here`_. Visit `Trunk.ly`_.

`PDF-processor`_: A friend was doing some very routine work with PDFs for an internship. Wrote this to automate the work. Unfortunately he wasn't allowed to put it to use.

`pf_random`_: A forum-spamming script. This was acually the first fully functional thing I ever completed.
