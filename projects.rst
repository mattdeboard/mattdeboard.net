Links

`Shrink-Link <https://github.com/mattdeboard/shrink-link>`_: A URL shortener written in Clojure using the `Noir <http://webnoir.org>`_ web framework and the `Korma <http://sqlkorma.com>`_ SQL DSL.

`SavedSearch <https://github.com/DirectEmployers/saved-search>`_: Django plugin to extend the excellent `Haystack <http://haystacksearch.org>`_ app. It provides support for user-defined, persistent queries.

`Yukmarks <http://yukmarks.com>`_ (`github <https://github.com/mattdeboard/yukproj>`_): A pinboard clone I started explicitly to learn more about databases and get my feet wet with Django. I still update and maintain it regularly. I also still use it, actually, almost a year later. Eating my own dog food and all that.

`Python-USDOL <https://github.com/mattdeboard/python-usdol>`_: Python wrapper for the US Dept. of Labor API. There's also a `Clojure variant <https://github.com/mattdeboard/clj-usdol>`_.

`Admin-Sentry <https://github.com/mattdeboard/django-admin-sentry>`_: A Django plugin to provide better representation of the Django admin logs. Inspired by David Cramer's `Sentry <https://github.com/dcramer/django-sentry>`_.
