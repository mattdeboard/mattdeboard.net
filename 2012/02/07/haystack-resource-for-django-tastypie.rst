summary: A drop-in Haystack resource class for django-tastypie APIs.

===========================
REST API for search results
===========================

So, first things first: `django-tastypie <https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie>`_ is pretty great. If you're running a Django web application and want to expose your data via a REST API, tastypie will do it. I got everything up-and-running in just a few hours (95% reading, 5% writing).

Tastypie -- written by `Daniel Lindsley <https://twitter.com/#!/daniellindsley>`_, the guy behind `django-haystack <http://haystacksearch.org>`_ -- uses a `Resource` class to handle all the API hairiness; it comes with a `ModelResource` subclass out of the box to provide an interface to a Django model & the ORM. If you want a better explanation, or want to know more, go `read the docs <http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Speaking of the documentation, there is an example `Resource` subclass in the docs' `cookbook <http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-tastypie/en/latest/cookbook.html#adding-search-functionality>`_, though that was more about adding search to an existing resource. We want to serve resources -- i.e. Solr documents -- exclusively from Lucene. Our resource is literally a document from the search engine, so we needed a class to model that behavior. (You can read more about how we use Solr `here <http://mattdeboard.net/2011/12/29/displacing-mysql-with-solr/>`_.) To accomplish this, I put together this `SearchResource` subclass which others may find useful.

      Blueprint for implementing an HTTP API to access documents in a
      search engine via Haystack. The design of the class adds some
      additional configuration overhead (i.e. a handful of metaclass
      fields) in exchange for flexibility & portability.
  
      To implement this class in your own application, you will need to:
      1. Define which fields to return in your results;
      2. Override index_fields in the metaclass to limit or expand which
         fields consumers can access from your index via the API;
      3. Override document_uid_field in the metaclass to specify which
         field in the index is used to uniquely identify individual
         documents;
      4. Additionally, you will override query_object and object_class to
         utilize any subclasses you may be using in your project.

If you use Haystack, you know that it goes to great lengths to emulate the API of Django's ORM to provide a familiar interface to the search index. In that vein, `SearchResource` emulates the `ModelResource` class. 

I made the decision to force some additional configuration overhead -- about 5 attributes on the metaclass -- in order to completely preserve the amazing extensibility of Haystack. I know that `in-house <http://directemployersfoundation.org>`_ we subclass just about everything from Haystack, including the `SearchQuerySet`; I assume there are others out there doing the same, and more, so you are not forced to use Haystack's built-in `SQ` object to compose query trees if you've created your own. (If you have I'd be curious to see it.)

Let me know in the comments if you have any problems, spot bugs or think I'm an idiot.
